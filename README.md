# Supply-Chain-Optimization

A repository for applying ML to optimize supply chain management, covering demand forecasting, inventory, logistics, and supplier selection. Includes Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and datasets for real-world applications.

## Features

- **Demand Forecasting**: Utilizing historical sales data to predict future demand using time series analysis and machine learning models to optimize inventory levels.
- **Inventory Management**: Implementing ML algorithms to determine optimal stock levels, reducing holding costs and minimizing stockouts.
- **Transportation Logistics**: Applying route optimization algorithms to reduce delivery times and costs, enhancing the efficiency of distribution networks.
- **Supplier Selection**: Using machine learning to assess and rank suppliers based on factors such as cost, quality, delivery time, and reliability, ensuring the best suppliers are chosen.
- **Production Scheduling**: Employing predictive models to optimize production schedules, balancing demand forecasts with production capacity and resource availability.
- **Risk Management**: Leveraging AI to identify and assess supply chain risks, such as supplier reliability or market fluctuations, allowing for proactive risk mitigation strategies.

## Requirements

- **Python**: A high-level programming language widely used for machine learning projects.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
